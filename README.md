# opticalflow

This assumes that you have amd64 arch, docker-ce installed, and your user is a part of the docker groups. 

Easy checks:
`docker run hello-world`

Groups:
`groups`
you should see docker. If you are not a part of the docker group, simply pre-pend sudo command to all docker commands.

Have image data ready in a folder 'data'. Create a list of the filenames for the before images and after images. Example of this may be seen in 'data/'

To run the benchmark use

Lucas-Kanade
`docker run -v ${PWD}/data:/data bjornborg/lucaskanade 10`
Farneb√§ck
`docker run -v ${PWD}/data:/data bjornborg/farneback 10`
Simple flow
`docker run -v ${PWD}/data:/data bjornborg/simpleflow 10`

All results are generated in ${PWD}/data/results. It is root owned folder. Simply chown or copy the folder if you want to do postprocessing.
